This R data package contains one single dataset --- the eponymous `hospitals` tibble --- comprising the up to date set of hospitals in the Portuguese National Health Service.

For a description of each variable and data sources used to assemble this dataset
browse the documentation with `?hospitals`.

## Installation

You can install the current version of hospitals with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nhs-pt/hospitals")
```

## The `hospitals` dataset

The `hospital_id` variable is a surrogate identifier created by us that ought to help researchers refer to hospitals in an unambiguous way. The idea is for these identifiers to never change. So if an hospital disappears, or is merged with another one, we will deprecate old identifiers and create new, accordingly.

```{r dataset}
library(hospitals)

hospitals[1:6] %>% print(n = Inf)
```

## Helper functions

### `sanitise()`

The names of the hospitals can have subtle variations. I provide a few functions
that help map hospital names found elsewhere to the values in the columns
`hospital_id` or `full_name`.

For example, with `sanitise` you can convert hospital names found elsewhere to
the names found in `hospitals$full_name`:

```{r map_wild_names}
sanitise(c('Hospital do Alto Minho'))
```

Also `sanitise` is aware of old hospital names, and can map to the new ones:

```{r map_old_names}
sanitise(c('Hospital do Alto Ave'))
```

The method behind `sanitise` for matching hospital names to their names in
`full_name` is based on an heuristic that uses a minimal set of keywords to
identify the hospital. So it is pretty tolerant to variations in the name as
long as one of the critical keywords is found in the name, e.g., to identify the
Hospital of Algarve as such only the keyword *Algarve* needs to be present in
the name:

```{r keywords}
sanitise(c('Algarve', 'H Algarve', 'Hospital do Algarve'))
```

Also `sanitise` should be lenient with typos associated with accented characters:

```{r accented_chars}
sanitise('Hospital de São João')

# Without the tildes the mapping still works fine
sanitise('Hospital de Sao Joao')
```

If you rather have the short version of the hospital names use the `form` argument:

```{r short_name}
sanitise('Matosinhos', form = 'short_name')

# 'full_name' is the default
sanitise('Matosinhos', form = 'full_name')
```


### `hospital_name_to_hospital_id()`

The function `hospital_name_to_hospital_id` uses the same heuristic as `sanitise` but returns the hospital identifier instead:

```{r hospital_name_to_hospital_id}
hospital_name_to_hospital_id(c('Matosinhos', 'Algarve'))
```

This can be useful if you need to map hospital names to some other variables in `hospitals`, as the `hospital_id` can be used as key in a join operation. For example, to get the legal status of the Hospital of Guarda and Hospital São José in Fafe you can do:

```{r hospital_name_to_hospital_id2}
hospital_name_to_hospital_id(c('Guarda', 'São José')) %>%
  tibble::tibble(hospital_id = .) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(hospitals, by = 'hospital_id') %>%
  dplyr::select(c('hospital_id', 'legal_status'))
```
