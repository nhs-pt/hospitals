#' Portuguese NHS hospitals
#'
#' A dataset of the Portuguese National Health Service hospitals.
#'
#' The concept of \emph{hospital} here
#' adopted is that of a legal entity providing hospital services. Depending on
#' the organisational structure of the entity, it may be a single hospital unit
#' (H), several hospital units that have been merged into one Hospital Centre
#' (CH), or a merge of hospital units and health centres into the so called
#' Unidades Locais de Saúde (ULS); the column \code{integration} indicates which
#' case is which.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 14 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{hospital_id}{A surrogate identifier created by this R package to
#'   identify unambiguously each hospital institution.}
#'   \item{acronym}{The acronym or initialism of the hospital name.}
#'   \item{legal_status}{Legal entity status: either an administrative public
#'   sector (SPA) entity, a corporate public entity (EPE) or a public-private
#'   partnership (PPP) entity. The legal status of SPA and EPE entities can be
#'   found in
#'   \href{https://data.dre.pt/eli/dec-lei/18/2017/02/10/p/dre/pt/html}{Decree-law
#'   18/2017}. For information about the legal status of the PPP entities see
#'   \href{https://data.dre.pt/eli/dec-lei/23/2020/05/22/p/dre}{Decree-law
#'   23/2020}. The Portuguese government may also establish contracts with
#'   hospitals owned by social enterprises, namely Private Institutions of
#'   Social Solidarity (IPSS). In this case, these hospitals become effectively
#'   part of the National Health Service. There are three types of contracts
#'   that can be established with IPSS which are regulated by the
#'   \href{https://data.dre.pt/eli/dec-lei/138/2013/10/09/p/dre/pt/html}{Decree-law
#'   138/2013}: Management Agreement (IPSS-MA), Cooperative Agreement (IPSS-CA)
#'   and Convention (IPSS-CN).}
#'   \item{integration}{The integration level of the hospital institution: a
#'   single hospital unit (\code{'H'}); \emph{Centro Hospitalar} (\code{'CH'}),
#'   comprising two or more individual Hospital units (a case of
#'   \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_integration}{horizontal
#'   integration}); and \emph{Unidade Local de Saúde}, comprising both Hospital
#'   entities and primary care health centres (a case of
#'   \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration}{vertical
#'   integration}).}
#'   \item{group}{One of the groups defined by
#'   \href{https://data.dre.pt/eli/port/82/2014/04/10/p/dre/pt/html}{Ordinance
#'   82/2014}: I, II, III, IV-a, IV-b or IV-c. This classification is based on
#'   the hospital catchment area and the scope of medical specialities provided.
#'   Broadly speaking, group I includes local hospitals, group II corresponds to
#'   regional hospitals, and group III to central hospitals. Group IV
#'   corresponds to specialised hospitals: IV-a, oncology institutes; IV-b,
#'   physical medicine and rehabilitation hospitals; and IV-c, psychiatry and
#'   mental health hospitals.}
#'   \item{short_name}{An abbreviated version of the hospital name.}
#'   \item{full_name}{The name of the hospital.}
#'   \item{region}{TODO}
#'   \item{vatin}{VAT identification number (VATIN). In Portuguese, \emph{Número
#'   de Identificação de Pessoa Colectiva} (NIPC).}
#'   \item{latitude}{Latitude of the location of the hospital entity expressed
#'   in decimal degrees.}
#'   \item{longitude}{Longitude of the location of the hospital entity expressed
#'   in decimal degrees.}
#'   \item{region_colour}{Colour associated with the \code{region}. These
#'   colours are assigned by this package and are provided as a convenience
#'   colour palette for plotting in R.}
#'   \item{bh_group}{One of the groups defined by the project Benchmarking of
#'   Hospitals. Source:
#'   \href{https://benchmarking-acss.min-saude.pt/BH_Enquadramento/GrupoInstituicoes}{BH | Grupos
#'   e Instituições}.}

#'   colour palette for plotting in R.}

#' The set of hospitals included in this dataset was created by manual
#' inspection of the hospital institutions referred in
#' \url{https://www.sns.gov.pt/institucional/entidades-de-saude/}, namely those
#' under the sections: \emph{Serviço Nacional de Saúde---Setor Público
#' Empresarial}, \emph{Serviço Nacional de Saúde---Setor Público
